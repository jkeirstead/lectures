DESCRIPTION 

The LaTeX 'beamer' package provides an excellent way to develop
lecture notes in a literate programming style, combining both detailed
background notes as well as presentation slides in a single source
file.  However users have to manually create wrapper files that will
build this source into the appropriate format.  

This software provides a set of templates and Python scripts to
automate the process.  Simply install the tool and type: 

> build-lecture source style 

from your working directory and it will automatically generate both
the slides and notes for the lecture, including any references you
might have used.

INSTALLATION 

To install the software: 

   1. Unzip the code into a convenient location.  

   2. Update your TeX search path to include the 'latex' directory.  

   3. Install the scripts.
      a) If on Windows, edit the SCRIPTDIR variable in the
'build-lecture.bat' file to match your local installation.  Then copy
the batch file to C:\Windows\System32 or another directory accessible
from the command line.

      b) If on a *nix system, you should be able to drop the
build-lecture.py script in the Python directory into a similar
location, like ~/bin.
