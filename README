DESCRIPTION 

The LaTeX 'beamer' package provides an excellent way to develop
lecture notes in a literate programming style, combining both detailed
background notes as well as presentation slides in a single source
file.  However users have to manually create wrapper files that will
build this source into the appropriate format.  

This software provides a set of templates and Python scripts to
automate the process.  Simply install the tool and type: 

> build-lecture source style 

from your working directory and it will automatically generate both
the slides and notes for the lecture, including any references you
might have used.

INSTALLATION 

To install the software: 

   1. Unzip the code into a convenient location.  

   2. Update your TeX search path to include the 'latex' directory. 
      a) If on Windows with MikTeX, go into Settings and click
      the update file database button.
      
      b) If on a *nix system, type:

      > texhash ~/lectures/latex
      
      	substituting with your local path as appropriate.  You may also
	need to set the TEXINPUTS environment variable.  This is a pain
	to set up but here's the bottom of my ~/.bashrc as an example:

# TEX 
TEXINPUTS=.:~/software/texmf//:/usr/share/texmf-texlive//:/usr/share/texmf//:
export TEXINPUTS

	This is on Ubuntu 10.04.

   3. Install the scripts.
      a) If on Windows, edit the SCRIPTDIR variable in the
'build-lecture.bat' file to match your local installation.  Then copy
the batch file to C:\Windows\System32 or another directory accessible
from the command line.

      b) If on a *nix system, you should be able to drop the
build-lecture.py script in the Python directory into a similar
location, like ~/bin.  You may need to add this directory to your
$PATH variable and also change the permissions on the file, e.g.

> chmod 766 build-lecture.py
